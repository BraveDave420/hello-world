# hello-world
Simple first repository

# About Me
1. I'm a fan of the Dark Souls series
2. I'm currently in a period of my life where I'm transitioning careers
3. I have a burning passion to learn in life

# My career goals
My main career goal at this point is to get into a cybersecurity role where I have complete control and mastery over all things digital. If it computes and stores data I want to know how to interupt that process and make it my own.
